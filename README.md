# üìÅ Level 3 - Task 1: Review Length and Rating Sentiment
## Description
Though full reviews were not provided, this task uses the `Rating text` column (e.g., "Excellent", "Good") to approximate sentiment and analyze whether review length correlates with the restaurant rating.

### What Was Done:
- Mapped short rating texts to Positive or Neutral/Negative sentiment.
- Measured the word count in each rating.
- Calculated correlation between rating length and numeric score.

### Insights:
- Most reviews are one-word responses.
- A negative correlation shows that higher ratings are typically shorter, suggesting simple and satisfied feedback.
